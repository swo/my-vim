# My vimrc

## Getting started

- Run `setup-links.py` to symlink your `~/.vimrc` and package directory to this repo's vimrc and package directory
- Run `download-packages.py` to download the packages in the package list

## Usage

Make sure to download new packages to this `start/` folder, *not* the `~/.vim/` folder structure

## To do

- Put in documentation about how to update the package list
- Is there a way to allow use of *both* folder locations? Like, can this complement other package lists in `~/.vim/` structure?
