# My vimrc

## Getting started

- Put `source /path/to/this/repo/.vimrc` into your `~/.vimrc`

## To do

- Make a script that automatically makes the global `.vimrc`
- Or, just symlink it?
- Consider symlinking `start/`, so that the cloned repos live here, rather than under `~/.vim/`
- Make it so that the target path isn't hard-coded
